                <h3>Package: 4 Days, 3 Nights</h3>
                <h4>Price: 12,000 INR</h4>
                <p>Mussoorie, also known as Queen of the Hills, is among the most popular hill stations of the country. A Britisher, Captain Frederick Young, accompanied by an official named FJ Shore, had climbed up the hill from the Doon valley in 1827 and found this ridge offering great views and a salubrious climate. This visit laid the foundation for this grand hill station. </p>

             <h3>Package: 4 Days, 3 Nights</h3>
             <h4>Price: 15,000 INR</h4>
             <p>The sandy coast of Goa is perfect for reclining by the sea. Nestle into a cushioned chair at a beach shack and savor a curry while you sip a Kingfisher beer, watching the sun slip lazily below the horizon. In Old Goa, the beautiful Basilica of Bom Jesus is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a fine example of baroque architecture. Visit during Christmastime to experience a fantastic religious and cultural mash-up of East and West.</p>

             <h2 class="seven">MANALI</h2>
             <h3>Package: 4 Days, 3 Nights</h3>
             <h4>Price: 10,000 INR</h4>
             <p>Nestled in the mighty Himalayas, Manali has an abundance of spectacular valleys filled with forests of oak, fir, deodar and pine. It is a full package of nature, food, adventure sports and ancient heritages. Splashing river Beas flows proudly amidst the valley. A lot of gushing waterfalls like Jogni falls and Rahala fall flush out of haphazardly placed rocks. You can also catch sights of sprawling meadows, terraced farming and fruit orchards.</p>
